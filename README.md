# Commodity-Price-Prediction-using-LSTMs

 We have used LSTM and ANN modelling to forecast the spot prices of selected commodities in the Indian commodities market.
 The commodities chosen were soybean, turmeric and kappas .
 These commodities were chosen as they seemed to be the highly traded commodities in the Indian market and formed an essential part 
 of the Dhaanya Index. The data was taken from the NCDEX, which ranged from May 2008 till November 2018. 
 80 percent of the data was used for training our model and 20 percent of it was used as a test set.
 The results showed that LSTM performed better than ANN in terms of accuracy of future price predictions.
 Since the modelling did not use specific characteristics of the commodities,
 LSTM could be used as a substantial model for forecasting future prices in general.
